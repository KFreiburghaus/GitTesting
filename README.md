## A Git Test Repository

This is a repository, where git-specific things are tried out in order to use them later in a "productive" project or to solve the existing problem. For every git specific *topic*, a separat branch would be created with the following scheme: `git branch feature/git-specific-thing`

<hr>

### Problems that have already been tried on this repository:

- What happens if you add a file to `.gitignore` that is already tracked?
